#Whiteboard Plugin
The Whiteboard plugin allows to use a dynamix instance as a temporary storage facility that can be used by all applications or other connected remote systems.

The whiteboard can store simple String key-value pairs and deliver the list of currently stored values to all aplications.

As such it can be used as a cookie system, a storage facility, a asynchronous communication platform and much more 
without any configuration or considerations to infrastructure.
